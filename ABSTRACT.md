As the authors of **Strawberry dataset for object detection** discuss, addressing labor shortages in the context of open-field strawberry production is a pressing concern. Introducing robotic solutions holds promise for round-the-clock field operations with minimal human oversight, offering long-term security to strawberry farmers. The paper, which this dataset was collected for, focuses on the critical aspect of detecting garden strawberries to guide a strawberry harvesting robot efficiently. A real-time implementation of a strawberry and peduncle detection system, designed to operate on an edge device, is presented. The paper discusses the prerequisites for the vision system, hardware and model selection, training procedures, and results achieved.
